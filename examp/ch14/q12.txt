#define M 10

a) #if M
this will work, however all statements engulfed in this statement will never proceed since M has to be one for that to happen. (1=true in C)

CORRECTION: it will proceed becuase C only checks if M is not 0, i.e. anything but 0 is defined as true.

WRONG: this will fail, since before compiling the M will be replaced with 10 and since that is numeric, and we cannot calculate if 10, this will not work
b) #ifdef M
this will return 1 if M is defined, 0 if otherwise. This will work.
c) #ifndef M
CORRECTION: checks if M is NOT defined. Gives 1 if not defined, 0 otherwise, therefore fails here

checks if M is defined earlier or in a different file, if not it will set M to a given value given in following statements
d) #if defined(M)
M is defined
proceeds
e) #if !defined(M)
M is not not defined, therefore fails
does not proceed
