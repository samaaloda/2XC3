Some of these advantages include programmers working together on seperate files which have unique different functions from each other. 
Only files on the header are visible, meaning all other functions are removed. Easier debugging.

Some of these disadvantages include not explicitly knowing how to integrate these files together, as they change perhaps to a different programmer.
