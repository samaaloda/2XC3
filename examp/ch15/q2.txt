a) function prototypes should be included as they will be the ones the linker can assure are there before being accessed. 

b) function definitions cannot be there as that is the purpose of the multiple files and a header file. Prototypes allow the compiler to identify where and what functions are there so they may be linked together.
+++Also because it can potentially define functions multiple times.
c) macro definitions should stay in their respective files to ensure that any definitions aren't overwritten each other. 
If the intention is for them to be the same, then they need to be placed in the header files.

d) type definitions should definitely be there for the compiler and linker to understand types of arguments and/or return types.
