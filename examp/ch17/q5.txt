a) is not legal, because you must derefernece p to get f, of which then can be accessed as ->b

b) not legal
CORRECTION: LEGAL b/c array of int is not primitive, must be accessed by -> :)

c) legal :)

d) legal :)

CORRECTION: NOT LEGAL because -> operator is used to reference another struct, whereas . is for primitive type attributes. This means that you can't access p->d->c but it should be p->d.c
