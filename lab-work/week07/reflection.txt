One advantage I see to treating arrays using pointer arithmetics is that it may be faster and more efficient that it would have been to access that index using indices. One disadvantage is that although treating arrays as pointers allows us to go to uncharted memory, arrays do not have a set size which means the size of the array you're indicating to always has to be given as an argument which makes the function less flexible. I prefer indices as currently, efficiency and time is not a big proplem for me, and they are easier to understand and use.
