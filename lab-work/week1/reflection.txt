I've learned about the CI Pipeline, including how Linux, Shell Scripting, C programming, Git and Github interact together. I've learned about how to make an executable file, a text file, and many different commands. I've learnt about the permission settings such as making files/directories readable, executable or writable. I'm excited to learn on how all these components of the CI Pipeline really work together. I'm worried about it as well since it is a completely new field that I have not touched into before.
